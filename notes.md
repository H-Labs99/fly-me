## What I've built
```
- First I created a `fecth_status` function in the `Client` module (client.ex)
- After that I use the `fetch_status` function in the `AppLive.Show` module to fecth the status of the app, and then pplug it in the final response 
```
## What I haven't built

## Improvements

## Sugestions
- Maybe there is a problem with app deletion:
I've deleted an app in my dashboard but afterward it reapeared again, even though it told me the action was irreversible
